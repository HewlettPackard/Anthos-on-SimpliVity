# Google Cloud's Anthos on HPE SimpliVity

# Ansible Deployment of Anthos Workstation and GKE on-prem Clusters

Google Anthos requires an administration workstation to be installed to perform on-prem cluster deployments.

This repository of ansible code will perform the following steps from a linux host of your choice **(Ubuntu 18.04 and Fedora 31 have been tested)**:

* Install Google Cloud SDK
* Download the gkeadm binary
* Deploy the Anthos admin workstation
* Provide post deployment configuration of admin workstation
* Deploy GKE on-prem admin cluster
* Deploy GKE on-prem user cluster(s)

## Getting Started

A Linux host is required for running these Ansible playbooks.  This environment has been tested with Ubuntu 18.04 LTS and Fedora 31. The host must be able to communicate to the target vcenter and subsequent gke admin host that is created.

The user account used to execute the ansible playbooks requires sudo with NOPASSWD to be enabled.  This can be done by adding the user to the ***wheel*** group and adding a line similar to this `%wheel ALL=NOPASSWD: ALL` to the sudoers configuration.

A Google Cloud account is required and service accounts created.

[Google site for getting started](https://cloud.google.com/anthos/gke/docs/on-prem/how-to/install-overview-basic)

[Information on required service accounts](https://cloud.google.com/anthos/gke/docs/on-prem/how-to/service-accounts)

The playbooks currently depend on having a whitelisted service account key file present on the deployment system.

## Installing Ansible

The use of a Python Virtual environment allows for flexibility in ansible host creation.  It also provides an easy method to freeze the version of required packages through the use of a requirements file.

The provided script `prerequisites/ansible-setup.sh` will build the python virtualenv needed to execute the playbooks.  

```text
~/Anthos-on-SimpliVity$ ./prerequisite/ansible-setup.sh -h

This script is used to create a python3 virtualenv with ansible operating environment
Syntax: ansible-setup.sh [-b|d|h]
options:
-b     Base directory to create python virtualenvs. (Optional - Default is ~/virtualenvs)
-d     Name to use for virtualenv directory. (Required)
-h     Print this Help.

ex.   ansible-setup.sh -b /home/sgifford/virtualenvs -d ansible29
```

## Variables Needed

### vSphere Virtual Center

```yaml

# Virtual Center Configuration that will be used to deploy GKE Admin Workstation
# and all GKE on-prem clusters (admin and user)
# All varibles that contain a vault_ prefix should be entered in `inventory/group_vars/all/vault.yml'
#
vcenter:
  address: '10.1.223.196'
  username: "{{ vault_vcenter_username }}"
  password: "{{ vault_vcenter_password }}"
  datacenter: 'Datacenter'
  datastore: 'ds1'
  cluster: 'New Cluster'
  network: 'VM Network 2'
  resourcepool: 'New Cluster/Resources/'
  cacertpath_gkeadm: "{{ local_secrets_path }}/vmware/vcenter.pem"
  cacertpath_gkectl: "{{ remote_secrets_path }}/vmware/vcenter.pem"
```

### GKE Admin Workstation

`gkeadm` requires a yaml configuration file for deploying the admin workstation.  Ansible
will generate this file based on the inputs provided in `inventory/group_vars/all/all.yml` in this section.

```yaml
#####
# GKE Admin Workstation Configuration
#####
gke_admin_workstation:
  secrets_path: '/home/ubuntu/gke_admin_wrkst_private'
  proxyUrl: 'http://16.100.208.216:8888'
  name: 'gke-adm-test-2'
  cpus: '4'
  memoryMB: '8192'
  diskGB: '50'
  ntpServer: 'hou-ntp1.hcilabs.hpecorp.net'
  ipAllocationMode: 'dhcp'
  # For Static IP assignment uncomment and enter info below. Remove ipAllocationMode: 'dhcp' above.
  #ipAllocationMode: 'static'
  #ip: '192.168.1.10'
  #gateway: '192.168.1.1'
  #netmask: '255.255.255.0'
  #dns:
  #  - nameserver_ip
  #  - nameserver_ip

# Path to GKE Admin Workstation OVA file to install. If defined and valid gkeadm will use this file.
# If empty '' or invalid gkeadm will download the OVA into the directory defined by the variable 'output_directory:'
# gkeadm_ova_path: '/home/sgifford/Downloads/1.3.0-gke.16/gke-on-prem-admin-appliance-vsphere-1.3.0-gke.16.ova'
gkeadm_ova_path: ''

# Path/Filename where ansible should create the yaml config file for deploying the GKE Admin Workstation
gkeadm_config: '{{ local_secrets_path }}/admin-ws-configtest.yaml'

# Path to ssh private key to install on GKE Admin Workstation
# This key will also be used by ansible to connect to admin workstation
ansible_ssh_private_key_file: '{{ local_secrets_path }}/dot-cfg-files/.ssh/vsphere_workstation'
```

The private key to connect to the admin workstation is currently a [user created vsphere_workstation](https://cloud.google.com/anthos/gke/docs/on-prem/archive/1.1/how-to/installation/admin-workstation) key and not the autogenerated key in the 1.3 GKE install.  Ensure the key has proper access:
`chmod 400 path_to_key/vsphere_workstation`

---

### Post Deploy Configuration

There are playbooks that allow for additional customization of the GKE Admin Workstation

Including:

* Configure apt proxy
* Configure docker proxy and private registry
* Configure git repos to be pulled automatically

These can be customized by editing the file `inventory/group_vars/all/all.yml` see sample below.

```yaml
---
# Docker bip (base IP) can be changed if the default conflict with your environment
docker_bip: '192.68.0.1/16'

# A private Docker registry is commonly used in Air-Gapped installations
private_docker_registry: true
private_reg_ip: '16.100.209.193'
private_reg_port: '5005'
private_reg_cert_path_gkeadm: '{{ local_secrets_path }}/private_docker_reg/registry.crt'
private_reg_cert_path_gkectl: '{{ remote_secrets_path }}/private_docker_reg/registry.crt'
private_reg_username: 'me'
private_reg_password: 'you'

# Proxy definitions -- gkeadm will have it's own. For now these are needed for post deploy configuration
proxy_address: '16.100.208.216'
proxy_port: '8888'
proxy_type: 'http'
no_proxy: '.hcilabs.hpecorp.net,.simplivt.local'

# Path to directory containing desired .ssh directory contents that will be copied to GKE Admin Workstaion.
# Used for git repo cloning.
ssh_config_path: '{{ local_secrets_path }}/dot-cfg-files/.ssh'

# Path to repos to pull after deployment. Do not change anthos_deploy_git, but update the anthos_userdata_git entry.
anthos_deploy_git:
  repo_name: anthos_wrkstation_files
  repo_url: 'ssh://git@stash.simplivt.local:7999/soleng/anthos_wrkstation_files.git'
anthos_userdata_git:
  repo_name: gke_admin_wrkst_private
# Change this url to match your private user data repo path
  repo_url: 'ssh://git@stash.simplivt.local:7999/~sgifford/gke_admin_wrkst_private.git'
```

---

### Anthos GKE on-prem cluster configuration

Similar to the GKE Admin Workstation configuration, the GKE on-prem cluster configuration is defined through variables in the `inventory/group_vars/all/all.yml` file under this heading. This section includes GKE on-prem cluster configuation variables and cluster creation control variables (e.g. running gkectl prepare, check-config etc)

```yaml
#####
# GKE on-prem cluster configuration
#####
```

---

### F5 Configuration

The F5 configuration is defined through variables in the `inventory/group_vars/all/all.yml` file under this heading.

```yaml
#####
# F5 Configuration Information
# All varibles that contain a vault_ prefix should be entered in `inventory/group_vars/all/vault.yml'
#####
```

---

### Protected Passwords/Keys for vSphere and F5 Configuration

The file `inventory/group_vars/all/vault.yml` contains the following variables used for the F5 playbook:

```yaml
vault_f5_root_password: "password"
vault_f5_admin_password: "password"
vault_f5_license_key: "license_key"
vault_vcenter_username: "username"
vault_vcenter_password: "password"
```

These need to entered before running the site.yml playbook.  To edit the file:

* source your python virtualenv
* run `ansible-vault edit inventory/group_vars/all/vault.yml --ask-vault-pass`
* type in the password when prompted (default password is `password`)
* edit/save file
* run `ansible-vault rekey inventory/group_vars/all/vault.yml --ask-vault-pass` and follow the prompts to change the password

When running ansible-playbook, you will need to specify `--ask-vault-pass` on command line.

---

## Sensitive Information Location(s)

The file `inventory/group_vars/all/all.yml` additionally contains variables that define the location of secrets files including:

* ssl certs
* ssh keys
* Anthos service account JSON files

In the example below the *_secrets_path refer to file locations on the respective targets (GKE Admin Wrkst or Ansible control host). They are rooted in the home directory of the local user running ansible OR the remote user used to connect to the GKE Admin Workstation (Default: Ubuntu). You need to define the path in the home directories where the secrets are located.  In this example, `gke_admin_wrkst_private` denotes the destination of a git repo that is pulled to both the ansible host and GKE Admin Workstation defined in `inventory/group_vars/all/all.yml` by the `anthos_userdata_git` variable.

```yaml
# Base Path for files that are sensitive e.g ssl certificates, files with passwords, Anthos service-account
# key files
# Path used when accessing files on GKE Admin workstation
remote_secrets_path: '/home/{{ ansible_user }}/gke_admin_wrkst_private'

# Path used when accessing files on Ansible control host
local_secrets_path: "/home/{{ lookup ('env', 'USER') }}/gke_admin_wrkst_private"'
```

These secrets are used in the following variable:

* secrets_path: "{{ remote_secrets_path }}"
* cacertpath_gkeadm: "{{ local_secrets_path }}/vmware/vcenter.pem"
* cacertpath_gkectl: "{{ remote_secrets_path }}/vmware/vcenter.pem"
* gkeadm_config: '{{ local_secrets_path }}/admin-ws-configtest.yaml'
* ansible_ssh_private_key_file: '{{ local_secrets_path }}/dot-cfg-files/.ssh/vsphere_workstation'
* private_reg_cert_path_gkeadm: '{{ local_secrets_path }}/private_docker_reg/registry.crt'
* private_reg_cert_path_gkectl: '{{ remote_secrets_path }}/private_docker_reg/registry.crt'
* ssh_config_path: '{{ local_secrets_path }}/dot-cfg-files/.ssh'

Note that you can create additional directory structure under the secrets_path to organize the files.

---

## Ansible Execution

* Ensure all variable files have been edited to reflect your environment
* cd Anthos-on-SimpliVity directory
* Activate your python virtualenv created earlier by ansible-setup.sh  `source 'path_to_env/bin/activate'`
* Execute `ansible-playbook site.yml --ask-vault-pass`

The last debug message from ansible will provide admin workstation login information similar to the following:

```json
ok: [gke-admin-ws -> localhost] => {
    "msg": [
        "Anthos Workstation Deployment Summary",
        [
            "Admin workstation version: 1.3.0",
            "Created using gkeadm version: 1.3.0",
            "VM name: gke-adm-ws13.0-200326-102803",
            "IP: 172.17.67.90",
            "SSH key used: /home/sgifford/.ssh/gke-admin-workstation",
            "To access your admin workstation:",
            "ssh -i /home/sgifford/.ssh/gke-admin-workstation ubuntu@172.17.67.90"
        ]
    ]
}
```
