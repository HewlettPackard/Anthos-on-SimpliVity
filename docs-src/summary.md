# Executive summary

Google™ Cloud’s Anthos is a hybrid and multi-cloud application platform that enables consistency between
on-premises and cloud environments. The platform allows you to modernize your applications on-premises or
in the cloud and helps you to easily deploy and elastically scale your applications. As a result, you can
reap the benefits of cloud-native microservices including increased agility, frequent releases, and
improved resilience.

HPE SimpliVity is an enterprise-grade hyperconverged platform uniting best-in-class data services with
the world’s best-selling server. HPE SimpliVity provides new levels of performance, from infrastructure
agility and resource fluidity to greater IT insights and visibility. By infusing artificial intelligence
(AI) into hyperconverged infrastructure (HCI) environments, HPE SimpliVity has dramatically simplified
and changed how customers can manage and support their infrastructure.

Deploying Anthos on HPE SimpliVity delivers the benefits of both platforms, on infrastructure validated
by Google and HPE. Anthos GKE deployed on-premises brings Google Kubernetes Engine (GKE) to your data
center in a VMware vSphere® 6.7 Update 3 environment and uses VMware vCenter Server® to manage your
clusters. Rolling out this solution will result in accelerated application development, centralized
management and upgrades, intelligent monitoring, increased resilience and optimized resource utilization.

**Target audience:** This is a solution guide for sales engineers, field consultants, IT administrators,
customers and anyone else that is interested in deploying Google Cloud’s Anthos with HPE SimpliVity 380
Gen10 on premise.

**Assumptions:** An understanding of containers, Kubernetes deployments and networking, Google Cloud
Platform, VMware® vSphere® deployment and administration, HPE SimpliVity deployment and administration,
and deployment of F5 BIG-IP® load balancers is assumed.

**Document purpose:** This deployment guide provides the details to assist you to deploy and operate
Anthos 1.4 or later on HPE SimpliVity 380 Gen10 (existing models) release 4.0.0 with VMware vCenter and vSphere ESXi 6.7 Update 3 or later. Solution testing was performed in July 2020.
